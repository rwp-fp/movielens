## Executive Summary

This report presents a summary of a project completed as the final part of the **HarvardX Data Science Program**. The project uses the data analysis and R programming skills learned during the program to estimate the ratings given to movies based on a range of predictors.

The project uses a dataset of 10 million ratings of movies. All movies are given a rating between 0 and 5. The aim of the project is to develop a methodology and R code which correctly predicts the rating a movie will receive.

The methodology I developed uses a range of predictors to estimate the rating a movie will receive. The starting point for the prediction is the average rating across all movies, this is

## Results

## Conclusion

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
